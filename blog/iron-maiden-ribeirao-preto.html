          <h1>Iron Maiden Concert at Ribeirão Preto</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          I'm not a fan of heavy metal and the musical genre figures very little
          in my playlists, but Iron Maiden is a band I always hear at one time
          or another. I know the classics and I can sing some choruses. I heard
          my brother and an old neighbor listen to "Fear of The Dark" and "The
          Number of the Beast" incessantly that that I have decorated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The riffs are remarkable, and the voice conveys with great perfection
          sensations that the lyrics awaken. And writing is something that
          appeals to me a lot in the band's songs. I love reading, watching, and
          hearing stories, and songs that report facts, narrate events – real,
          fictitious or myths – is something that interests me a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, Iron has the nostalgia factor. Every time I hear it, I remember
          my childhood. When my brother put his songs to play at a higher
          volume, he, who took care of me while my mother worked, would put me
          out with a bowl of water to play with. There in the hallway I was
          between the dolls, the water, and the sound waves of heavy metal.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't remember if I liked the situation or not, but I remember being
          afraid of some songs. I don't know exactly which ones, but, as I said,
          the chords and the voice of this genre of music can convey many
          sensations. Maybe it could also be just the fact that I'm alone in the
          hallway with a deafening noise.
        </p>

        <p>
          And last Tuesday, 30, the British band brought their show to my
          hometown, Ribeirão Preto. Me and my girlfriend bought the tickets as
          soon as the sales started and we longed for the show and, I say with
          certainty, that the expectation we had was fulfilled with a large
          positive margin.
        </p>

        <p>
          She already had experience with major international shows, but I
          didn't what to expect. I hadn't even watched the band's shows on
          YouTube. I knew the clips of some songs, but I had no idea of the
          concert that would take place at the Santa Cruz stadium that night.
          "What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw that night was real and
          not just fantasy?"
        </p>

        <p>
          We called an Uber and long before we arrived on site, traffic was
          already heavy. We went down and finished the way on foot. On the
          sidewalk, many street vendors and I ended up buying a stylized t-shirt
          of the band in the form of a football team uniform. It made my
          girlfriend laugh, since I do not wear printed clothes, much less from
          bands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Poser or not, I wanted to feel the full experience and I think the
          shirt was a great souvenir of a memorable evening. The opening band,
          Avatar, was something completely theatrical and visual, but nothing
          comparable to what the main band had prepared. The scenery, costumes
          and choreographies of the Iron Maiden show were simply sensational.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything was surprising and exaggerated. Fireworks, flames, and huge
          inflatable objects appeared on stage, such as Icarus flying into the
          sun, a large Royal Air Force plane, as well as, of course, a giant
          Eddie head and his incarnation as a samurai portraited by an actor who
          acted with the band members.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the show, pains in the feet, legs and back, sleep and
          general tiredness hid my excitement at having experienced an
          incredible and remarkable concert. But, as my girlfriend told me, we
          going to tell and retell this story about the day we went to the Iron
          Maiden show right here, in Ribeirão Preto, for a lot of people.
