          <h1>Trip to São Thomé das Letras</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          This was my first long trip driving a car and I was really anxious
          about that. Me and my girlfriend planned our trip with months in
          advance so nothing could go wrong. I think that we wanted to go to São
          Thomé das Letras since we first met.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was Friday and I still had some stuffs to do from work, so my girl
          took care of most of the preparation for the trip while I was
          finishing my job. After some delay, mostly because of me, we were on
          the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          The car, a Volkswagen Gol 1995, was full of bags, food and joy. My
          girl started driving and we would change sits after she gets tired.
          Five hours of driving was expecting us. The first two were fun. We
          listened to pop music and talked about the landscape and things that
          we saw on the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the night came with rain. We exchanged sits and I was behind the
          wheel. I barely could see the road. Minas Gerais roadway is known for
          the precarious conditions, holes, and big trucks. Most are single lane
          too. So, I drove slowly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cars that came against me with high beams obfuscated my view and I
          couldn't see nothing for 2 or 3 seconds. It was scary. At some point,
          I saw a car behind me and I let It pass. My plan was to follow its
          backlight because I was afraid of getting out of the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could see where I was going, but not the holes, and the car passed
          through a lot of them. My girlfriend was mad at me because if I wasn't
          late, we wouldn't take the highway at night. When we finally found our
          AirBnB, we found relief too.
        </p>

        <p>
          We woke up next day and saw how beautiful our guesthouse was. It was
          in the middle of nature, and I could hear the birds singing, the sound
          of running water and we were visited a lot of times by two cute dogs.
        </p>

        <p>
          São Thome das Letras is a small city, but it's full of tourists all
          the time, even late night. Me and my girlfriend went to a lot of
          places, ate things that we didn't know it existed, like "peixinho", a
          delicious fried leaf, and of course we experimented cheeses and
          coffees.
        </p>

        <p>
          But we went there for the natural beauties. We went to different
          tourist spots, like Casa da Pirâmide, Morro do Cruzeiro and others
          places, and we fell in love for the waterfalls. We passed a lot of
          times talking and chilling by the waterfalls.
        </p>

        <p>
          We stayed for 5 days and, this time, we left in the morning. We took
          the opportunity to pass by Três Corações and I visited the house where
          Pelé was born. It was a little house with some memorabilia. Was a nice
          memory for the king of football, but São Thomé was way more than I
          could expect.
