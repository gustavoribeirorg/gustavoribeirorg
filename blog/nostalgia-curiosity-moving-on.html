          <h1>Nostalgia, curiosity, and moving on</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          During my conversations with my therapist, I managed to identify and
          differentiate longing from nostalgia. I understood that recalling and
          associating moments and situations with the past is not wrong but
          rather natural.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I felt curious, and what I saw didn't make me sad. In fact, it
          made a lot of sense and, to some extent, it made me happy. Happy
          because I realized the constancy and continuity of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as it was with me today, she continues to move forward. I dare
          say faithfully. The same companion that was once with me now follows
          the path of another love, someone who perhaps deserves her in a way I
          could no longer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I pondered a lot before indulging my curiosity. Last time, it didn't
          do me any good. Today, I believe it was worth it. I still write
          without fully comprehending my feelings, but there was no shock or
          tears. It's been so long.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's still challenging to separate the before and after. I try to
          imagine how your life is, how you've been, how you met your current
          partner, what your routines are like, but all I have are social media
          photos. Everything else is the fruit of my imagination.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also moved on, but I still relate many current situations to past
          experiences. I lack the courage to discuss this with anyone. I don't
          think it's right. I attempt to fathom why, even after so long, this
          story still resides within me.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are few answers. What remains for me is to continue living and
          creating new memories to supplant the four years of blocks that I
          constructed with someone who no longer resides in this structure. In a
          way, a part of me still holds a part of her.
        </p>

        <p>
          You've changed, but your face and expressions remain the same. That's
          how I realized, through the photos, that you're happy. I knew you like
          no one else did. Your smile and the strength in your intertwined hands
          convey what I once possessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the issue with the interconnected world. Everything is readily
          available. With a few clicks, my imagination gave way to reality. It
          wasn't difficult, but the image on the screen brought back four years
          I've been trying to leave behind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nevertheless, it was worth it. Now I know how you are. This was my
          curiosity, and I've satisfied it. From this point forward, I don't
          want to erase it from my memory but to create space for new moments
          and a future without the fear of encountering you, living.
        </p>

        <p>
          I contemplate how common or natural my feelings are, but I strive to
          understand that the time we spent together was so intense that it's
          etched within me in a way that I won't be able to overwrite the entire
          story in such a short time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Soon, I'll be thirty years old. You've turned twenty-eight. When I met
          you, I was so young that I wasn't your type. Now, I'm a part of your
          story just as you're a part of mine, and I'll move forward carrying
          all the growth we experienced together, attempting to apply it to my
          future relationships.
