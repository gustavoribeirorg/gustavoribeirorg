          <h1>I don't care about the Metaverse</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          The first time I heard about metaverse was when Facebook announced the
          group name change to Meta. As I work with marketing and our main
          product dissemination platform are from Facebook, this has generated a
          certain frenzy in our industry. Over the days, we realized that change
          would not affect our work, but would have profound consequences for
          digital culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was an explosion of news about the name change and facebook's
          new positioning, which has now focused its engineers on building the
          "metaverse." Stories in portals, newspapers, and magazines, tv
          reports. It all talked about the revolution that Meta was planning for
          years to come. A completely connected and digital world.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the reports I saw was from a reporter from Fantástico, at
          Globo, interviewing Mark Zuckerberg in a digital environment. The
          reporter in a room in Brazil and Mark, elsewhere on the globe, met in
          a virtual office interpreting "dolls", their digital avatars, with the
          help of "virtual reality" glasses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the months, dozens of platforms have emerged and promised the
          same metaverse experience. Many companies have announced events in the
          metaverse, as well as lectures, parties and even weddings. To
          participate is very simple: with your computer (or mobile phone),
          access the link provided, customize your avatar and start to follow
          everything through the screen of your computer, in the comfort of your
          home or office.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somehow, it attracts people a lot. I spent a lot of time playing
          Second Life, Minecraft, Habbo, GTA Online and Mu, but I saw it
          differently. For me, it was leisure and fun and, despite having all
          the same items of the metaverse of Facebook (except leisure and fun),
          it was not considered a post-reality universe where everything would
          happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is worth noting that the change of identity came after a long
          period of controversy, through the case "Facebook–Cambridge Analytica"
          and the leak of documents and internal analyses that showed that Meta
          was aware of the negative effects that its platforms had on society,
          especially in adolescents who used Instagram, Facebook's contribution
          to the evolution of violence in developing countries, the ease of
          disseminating false information, publications with hate content,
          self-harm and anorexia.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Internet has evolved a lot since it was created and many things we
          imagined impossible are now accessible thanks to the worldwide network
          of computers, but the technology has become increasingly invasive.
          Many services and products that were symbols of unification and
          breaking of boundaries between people, such as emails and social
          networks, have transformed to satisfy interest in profits of large
          corporations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Big Techs are increasingly present in our lives and homes with the
          conveniences they have created. Traffic, transportation, shopping,
          relationship, entertainment, etc. applications. Now, the idea of the
          metaverse is no longer simple convenience, but complete dependence on
          the "virtual world" created by these companies. Much more intrusive,
          the metaverse also dehumanizes people. In this environment, you are
          just a representation of what you are in real life, an avatar.
        </p>

        <p>
          The equipment needed for us to experience the entire metaverse is
          already under development, and together with them new forms of
          surveillance and data collection. Oculos VR contains tracking
          technology that features orientation and motion sensors and external
          mapping cameras.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will be added to all the other data these companies have on us
          and will create a new era of advertising, something like Minority
          Report, The Matrix or Blade Runner. In addition, many corporations are
          already thinking about ways to make money in this environment as the
          Earth's physical resources become increasingly scarce. Meta works on
          the development of a cryptocurrency and large companies already sell
          digital products for high values based on the artificial creation of
          scarcity. A capitalist dream. In the metaverse, we will literally be a
          product.
