        </header>

        <p>
          Since I was a kid, I've been very much into rap, and I've always been
          involved in hip-hop culture in some way. I learned break steps,
          attended events, and consumed a lot of information on the subject. My
          brother was always connected with music and was part of several bands.
          When he bought the first computer, he also acquired an external sound
          card to record guitar solos and bass lines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Watching him, I learned to do the same, but I don't know how to play
          any instruments, so I just kept playing in the software and recording
          some no sense freestyle rhymes. With a large library of knowledge at
          my disposal, the world wide web, I researched and studied about music
          production, especially rap, to better understand how the construction
          of one of the pillars of hip hop culture worked.
        </p>

        <p>
          I discovered FL Studio, Slicex, FPC and learned about the famous use
          of samples. Pieces of music that producers use to create other
          compositions, most from obscure and forgotten records in some corner
          of the thrift store. Of course, I also knew the tools used by the
          great beatmakers: MPC and turntables. World rap classics were produced
          only with these two instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still dream of an MPC, but the old Fruity Loops has amused me a lot
          and solved my need to create something completely different from an
          unknown work. This process fascinates me and whenever I'm listening to
          my raps, a computer tab sits on the WhoSampled.com so I can find out
          where that sample came from and try to unravel the process behind the
          production.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every time, I'm really fascinated by the ability of these beatmakers
          to listen to something and imagine another song with that piece of
          guitar, bass, piano or, in some cases, words and phrases. A few
          seconds of samples are enough for the producer to craft a beat and
          completely transform the original composition. Only trained ears can
          trace the path to the music that originated the beat.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first creations were reproductions of famous beats, with samples
          already known, and this already excited me. As I got to know the
          software better and getting the way to chop and rearrange the samples,
          I tried to create. My source was YouTube, where I spent hours of my
          day listening to songs from various genres trying to find a rough
          diamond to cut.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that also formed my musical personality. I just listen to all
          kinds of music, and so I put up a lot of baggage. I don't know
          everything, obviously, but I'm surprised when I hear some beat and I
          can identify where it came from or think "I've heard it somewhere
          before". Researching and listening to new music should be in
          everyone's routine.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had midi controllers that facilitated the composition process and
          cut many samples of songs downloaded on YouTube but listening and
          recording something directly from the vinyl player still hung in my
          imagination. I know there's not much difference in the final process,
          but I wanted to do it the same way the old ones did. And recently, I
          heard a vinyl and recorded the sound that it played on my computer to
          chop and create a beat.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still have the sound card that my brother bought over 10 years ago,
          and it works great. Last month, I went to live with my girlfriend and
          she's passionate about music and has a vinyl player, plus, of course,
          a lot of vinyl. I chose something that wouldn't exist anywhere: a
          vinyl with songs by local composers, one of them from my own
          father-in-law, and it was this song that caught my attention. I
          haven't done anything too much, I just recorded the music on my
          computer. Soon I'm going to chop some parts that I found interesting
          and try to build something. I've got it all in my head.
        </p>

        <p>
          And although it's not the same way the pioneers did - recording
          excerpts of the song at MPC and chopping the sample directly on it -
          it was a moment that gave me a lot of satisfaction and joy. Touching
          the needle on the correct track, regulating the volumes, and starting
          the recording was like I was playing music, feeling touchy, with my
          own hands. It was a magical moment.
