          <h1>I finally bought my own apartment</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          Next month will be the first month that my mom and I will not pay the
          rent. Since she came to Ribeir√£o Preto, she has lived in many
          different houses and apartment buildings. I was born in one house,
          raised in another, and spent my teenage years in three others.
        </p>

        <p>
          My brother hasn't lived with my mom for almost ten years because she
          shared the house with two other girls. We didn't have a place to call
          home, and I've never felt connected to any place where I lived with my
          family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anytime the landlord would call and tell us that we needed to move.
          The first house that I remember had three rooms, and my brother, my
          mom, and I slept in the same bedroom for more than 10 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 15 years old, we moved to a home with three bedrooms, and
          that was the first time that I slept alone. It was a nice apartment,
          and we lived in that apartment complex for 7 or more years.
        </p>

        <p>
          About a year ago, I started living with my girlfriend, but the dream
          of having my own place was still with me. I wanted to buy a house so
          my mom would stop paying rent and I could have a place to call my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          My girlfriend at the time had bought an apartment, and I followed the
          process with her. I also tried to buy one at the time, but with no
          success. Almost one year later, I talked to a realtor and tried again.
          This time, I wanted to buy the apartment where my mom already lived.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was too expensive, but the realtor found another one in the same
          apartment complex for almost half the price. It needed a new paint job
          and a lot of other things that needed fixing, but we finally have our
          own apartment now.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan was for my mother to live there alone while I was with my
          girlfriend, but destiny had something different in mind, and now my
          mother and I are living together again. I'm really happy and have a
          lot of plans for the apartment.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the first two weeks after I got the keys, we cleaned and repainted
          everything. It's an old apartment, and it was empty for a long time,
          so it was really dirty. A friend of my mom came over and helped with
          the cleaning, and we hired a painter for the walls, windows, doors,
          and closets.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried to wash the curtains in the washing machine, but they came out
          all crimped. Luckily, my washing machine wasn't big enough to fit more
          than one at a time. After that failed attempt, I cleaned the remaining
          curtains with a cloth. They still look a little grimy, but I managed
          to remove the more visible dirt and dust.
        </p>

        <p>
          My bedroom still needs some work. My desk doesn't fit the way I wanted
          it to, and I will ask a friend to help me saw it. Besides that,
          everything is in its place. We even have a hammock in the living room!
          It's a perfect place to read or watch TV.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is a great achievement for my family and me. Soon my brother will
          be with us too and enjoy our family home. We only have two bedrooms,
          but we'll find a way for him to sleep. He'll stay only for a few
          weeks, but I'm looking forward to being with him and enjoying our home
          together!
