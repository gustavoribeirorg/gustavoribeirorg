          <h1>My theory for season three of Apple TV's Severance</h1>
        </header>

        <h2>James Eagan will try to adopt Helly R.</h2>

        <p>
          As we saw in episode 9, Eagan came to the MDR room and found Helly R.
          alone with the lights off, trying to memorize the directions left by
          Irving B. to the dark hallway with the elevator at the end. After
          saying that she tricked him, James called her "my Helly." In the next
          episode, they continue the dialogue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eagan goes on saying that he doesn't love his daughter because he
          doesn't see Kier in her anymore after she grew up, stating that he
          sired others in the shadows but couldn't see Kier in them either,
          until finally saying that he saw Kier again in Helly R. She treats him
          with a pen, and James proceeds by saying, "There he is."
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe Helly R. will play along with this to survive and will try to
          add a condition to save Mark S. too. Mark S. had sex with Helly R. and
          Helena Eagan. Probably, she will be pregnant in season 3 and will use
          this against James Eagan to get what she wants, even if it's a fake
          pregnancy, saying that Mark S. is the father of an Eagan.
        </p>

        <h2>Gemma and Devon will try to save Mark Scout</h2>

        <p>
          Gemma, a.k.a. Ms. Casey, will join forces with her sister-in-law to
          try to save Mark Scout. They already know they can't count on Mark S.,
          so they will elaborate a plot to bring Mark S. out of the Lumon
          building. I don't think that this will be an easy task because Mark S.
          now knows that if he gets out of the severed floor, he might not get
          back.
        </p>

        <p>
          To accomplish this, both will count on help from Helena Eagan and Ms.
          Selvig, a.k.a. Ms. Harmony Cobel. Helena will be driven by hatred
          after discovering his plans with Helly R. On the other hand, Cobel
          wants to get credit for her invention, the severance procedure.
        </p>

        <h2>Reintegration will be a central point</h2>

        <p>
          For James's plan to work, Helly R. and Mark S. need to be permanently
          severed, but Mark S./Scout's reintegration will start working, and
          both personalities will fight each other for control. Gemma knows that
          she is severed and will try to communicate with Ms. Casey to know more
          about the severed floor, maybe even trying to go down there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Helena knows more about Lumon and the severance procedure, and with
          the help of Selvig/Cobel, will try to do something to take over Helly
          R. Maybe a reintegration when she is out of the Lumon building. I
          think Seth Milchick will change sides too, but because he wants more
          recognition, and this desire will clash with Selvig/Cobel's plans.
          However, he will be part of the strategy to get Mark S. and Helly out
          of the building.
        </p>

        <p>Irving will be back.</p>
