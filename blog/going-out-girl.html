          <h1>Going out with a girl from Tinder</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
          I would start this blog entry by saying, "Today was a good day," but
          it actually happened last Saturday. I'm still dealing with my abrupt
          breakup. I can't say anymore that I didn't see it coming because
          almost two months later, I can think about a lot of signs that we
          showed each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, I'm not writing about that. As mentioned, Saturday was a good
          day. I connected with this girl on Tinder, and we chatted for about a
          week before arranging our in-person meeting. I suggested visiting a
          newly opened brewery pub in my city.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was my second time there, but the first one with good company. That
          girl works in social media, but she's also really talented at writing
          poems. She talked a lot about her passion, read some poems to me, told
          stories, and we laughed a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a cold night, and we were not dressed for it, so I invited her
          to take a ride around the city in my car. And there we were. She
          didn't stop talking, and I think this happens when people feel
          comfortable with the company.
        </p>

        <p>
          We went to a quiet neighborhood, but she thought it was too calm, so I
          took her to a skatepark. I grabbed a blanket that I had in the car and
          offered it to her, and we sat by the ramp and talked about the
          graffiti, an owl, and many other things.
        </p>

        <p>
          She wanted more beer, so we went to a gas station and stayed there for
          an hour or more. While we were there, the thought passed through my
          mind several times. It felt like we had already known each other for a
          long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The night wasn't over yet, and I took her to a different place. We
          went to a park that people call "Praça da Rodonaves." Rodonaves is a
          logistics company, and they maintain the park by trimming the plants
          and trees in the shape of flying saucers ("naves" means "ships" in
          Portuguese).
        </p>

        <p>
          It was almost 4 a.m. when she decided that she wanted to go home. I
          dropped her off at her place and then returned to my apartment. It was
          actually a good night. Despite everything I've been through, I felt
          well again.
